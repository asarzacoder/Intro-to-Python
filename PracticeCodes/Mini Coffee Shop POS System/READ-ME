Goals:
    + Create a terminal program that acts like a tiny checkout system (think: small store / cafe).

Functions:
    + Ask users for item information
    + Applies discounts
    + Calculates totals
    + Prints a clean receipt

Core Requirements:
    Inputs (strings and numbers) ->
        + Customer name
        + Item name
        + Item price
        + Quantity
        + Member status (Y/N)
        + Coupon code

Computations:
    + Subtotal: price * quantity
    + Tax (rate = 8.75 %) = subtotal * tax_rate
    + Total before discount = subtotal + tax
    + Discounts:
        - Member + subtotal > 50 -> 15% off subtotal
        - Coupon code (SAVE5) -> $5 off subtotal
            ' subtotal should not go below 0 '
