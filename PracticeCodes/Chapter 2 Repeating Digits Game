Description: Repeating digits game

Several math games manipulate numbers in simple ways that yield fun results.
Below is a program that takes any given two-digit number and outputs a six-digit number, repeating the two digits.
Ex: 24 becomes 242424.

Takes a three-digit number and generates a six-digit number with the three-digit number repeated.
Ex: 391 becomes 391391.
    -> The rule is to multiply the three-digit number by 7*11*13.

Takes a five-digit number and generates a ten-digit number with the five-digit number repeated.
Ex: 49522 becomes 4952249522.
    -> The rule is to multiply the five-digit number by 11*9091.
