                                                Intro to Python
Vocabulary ->
    + Python interpreter: Computer program that executes code written in Python language.
    + Interactive interpreter: Program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time.
    + Console (terminal): text-based interface that allows user to run programs, enter input, and view output.
    + Command-line interface: allows user to enter commands to run programs and work with files.
    + Programmers write code in Script files (.py) then run the files using the Python interpreter.

Subject-> Output and Inputs

Outputs ->

    print("..............") | print(variable_name) | print(variable_name, "...", variable_name)

    + Each print statement starts on a new line.
    + Each line does NOT end in semi-colon (;).
    + Output can be moved to the next line using the (\n) new line character.
    + Single output lines with multiple strings and variables are separated by commas (,).
        - A space character is automatically added between each string/variables.
    + (#) is used to provide comments on lines.

    print("Hello there.", end=" ")  | Output: Hello there. My name is Armando.
    print("My name is Armando.")    |

    + Keep the output on the same line per print() by placing (end=" ").

Inputs ->

    best_friend = input() | number = int("15") | hourlyWage = int(input("Enter hourly wage: "))

    + The (input()) function will read text from user input and assign it to the variable.
    + By default, reading from input results in String type.
        - insert type function before input() to change input String into Integer.
    + Adding a string inside the parenthesis of input() displays prompt to the user before waiting for input.
